Algorithm
-------
TGDR-based neural network for survival analysis with high-dimensional covariates


Usage
-------
This is a package for building the CNT model.

1. The "Function_For_Demo.py" file contains all the functions  in our proposed method;

2. The "Demo.py" file provides one demonstrating example;

3. When using the code, run "Function_For_Demo.py" first and then "Demo.py".
